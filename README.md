# Security

When a user creates an account a private key is generated and stored on their device. The public key is stored with the user credentials to allow other users to encrypt messages with the intended recipient being the only person who can decrypt it. 

Sort of like [SyncThing](https://www.syncthing.net/), messages are not stored - instead they are syncronised between devices when both are online. Thankfully mobile devices are almost permanently online so must users should not notice any difference when using this service. 

## Future

- Sync user messages between devices
